1. Compile the code. See the top of "Makefile" for a list of targets to pick one best suited for you.

Some common targets:

   all - Will use your provided CFLAGS / LDFLAGS or choose machine-independent optimized flags if none provided.
   native - Will build optimized for the current system. Will likely only run on current processor or better
   static - Will build static versions of executables ( no dynamic library links )
   static-native - Will build static versions of executables optimized for current system.


2. Install the executables

For local installation:
    
    Use  `make install`

      This will detect if /usr/bin is writeable by current user, and if so install there.
      Otherwise, it will install in $HOME/bin

For alternate path:

    Use `make install PREFIX="/usr/local"`  to install to /usr/local/bin , for example.

For package installation:

  RPM: 

    Use `make install DESTDIR="$RPM_BUILD_ROOT/usr"` for the RPM to contain executables in /usr/bin . Change "/usr" to alternate prefix if desired.

  Archlinux (PKGBUILD):

    Use `make install DESTDIR="${pkgdir}/usr"` for the pacman PKG to contain executables in /usr/bin. Change "/usr" to alternate prefix if desired.
